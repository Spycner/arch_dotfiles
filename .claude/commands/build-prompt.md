# Prompt Builder - Anthropic's 10-Step Framework

I'll help you build a well-structured prompt following Anthropic's best practices from their Prompting 101 workshop. This creates a `.prompt.md` working document in your current directory that you can iteratively improve.

## Creating Your Prompt Structure

**User Request**: $ARGUMENTS

Let me create a structured prompt template based on the 10-step framework:

1. **Task Context** - Define the role and scenario
2. **Tone Context** - Set expectations for confidence and factual accuracy  
3. **Background Data** - Provide consistent context and form structures
4. **Detailed Instructions** - Step-by-step reasoning guidance
5. **Examples** - Few-shot learning with complex scenarios
6. **Conversation History** - Relevant context from previous interactions
7. **Immediate Task** - Clear description of what to do now
8. **Thinking Process** - Guide the reasoning approach and order
9. **Output Formatting** - Structure the response with XML tags
10. **Prefilled Response** - Shape the output format (if needed)

I'll analyze your request and create a comprehensive `.prompt.md` file with:

- **Structured sections** following the Anthropic framework
- **XML tags** for organization and reference
- **Best practice guidance** from the workshop
- **Examples and templates** for each section
- **Iteration notes** for prompt engineering improvement

### Key Principles from the Workshop:

- **Empirical approach**: Prompt engineering is iterative and empirical
- **Order matters**: Sequence of information affects Claude's reasoning
- **Structure helps**: XML tags and clear organization improve results
- **Context is king**: Background information should be in system prompt when consistent
- **Prevent hallucination**: Guide Claude to only make confident assessments
- **Step-by-step reasoning**: Guide the analysis order (e.g., form first, then sketch)
